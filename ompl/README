# These are instructions for updating the ROS package that wraps the release of OMPL from Rice University. 
# These instructions are only intended for and useful to the maintainers (Willow Garage) of the OMPL ROS wrapper package and have limited to no utility for users. 
# Get the ROS package for OMPL as provided by Rice:
svn co https://rice-ros-pkg.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/rice-ros-pkg/ompl
cd ompl

# To get the latest version of the library, do:
make arch

# To get a particular tag/revision of the library, do:
OMPL_REVISION=1001 make arch

This will create a file of the form ompl-*.tar.gz and a file ompl-*.tar.gz.md5sum that can be used in the Willow Garage ROS package.
