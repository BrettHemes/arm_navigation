\b collision_free_arm_trajectory_controller provides a ROS node with an interface similar to the joint trajectory action. The node can be used to execute collision-free trajectories, i.e. the node will not allow the arm to move if it thinks there is going to be a collision with the environment at any point in the trajectory. The node only has a ROS API that is documented on the <a href="http://www.ros.org/wiki/collision_free_arm_trajectory_controller">Wiki page for the node. </a>

Provide an overview of your package.

<!--
Provide links to specific auto-generated API documentation within your
package that is of particular interest to a reader. Doxygen will
document pretty much every part of your code, so do your best here to
point the reader to the actual API.

If your codebase is fairly large or has different sets of APIs, you
should use the doxygen 'group' tag to keep these APIs together. For
example, the roscpp documentation has 'libros' group.
